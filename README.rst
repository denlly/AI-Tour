Overview
--------
This is a test case about building a HTML style documentation based on Markdown or reStrcutruredText maintained from github.

The goal is:

* To have, build and mantain all the documentation in github.
* Create a new documentation site in `Read The Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_.
* Connect the documentation site with the repository.
* Build the documetation as HTML web and PDF downloadable.
* Repository and Documenation site should be able to be setup as private sites.


See `index <doc/index.rst>`_ to get the whole documentation and steps.

.. note:: The README.rst file and doc/index.rst should be exactly the same.
